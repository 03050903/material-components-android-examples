## Introduction
Owl is an educational app that uses Material Design components and [Material Theming](https://material.io/design/material-theming) to create an energetic, motivational brand experience.
This project is an Android implementation of [Owl](https://material.io/design/material-studies/owl.html), a Material study meant to showcase componentry and theming using the [Material Components for Android library](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android).

## Material Theming
Owl employs material theming to reflect the energy and excitement of learning a new skill, using a bold aesthetic and unfilled shapes that invite the user to populate them with new content and courses. The app customizes [color](https://material.io/develop/android/theming/color/), [shape](https://material.io/develop/android/theming/shape/) and [typography](https://material.io/develop/android/theming/typography/) to achieve this.

### Color

Owl has three primary colors. Each color is used to create a distinct visual theme for each section. See [colors.xml](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/color.xml) and how they are used in [light](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/theme.xml#L58-L86) and [dark](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values-night/theme.xml) themes.

### Shape

Owl defines small, medium and large shape categories for different sized components. See [shape.xml](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/shape.xml) which defines the `ShapeAppearance`s, which are then [set in the theme](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/theme.xml#L20-L23) and picked up by all components or refferred to directly.

### Typography

Owlâ€™s type scale provides the typographic variety necessary for the app content. All items in the type scale use [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) as the typeface, and make use of the variety of weights available by using Rubik Regular, Medium, and Bold. See [type.xml](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/type.xml) which defines `TextAppearance`s which are then [set in the theme](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/theme.xml#L25-L38) and referred to using `?attr/textAppearance[...]` throughout.
